# Incident Response Plan â€” Malware Infection

## Overview
This repository contains a simple, practical Incident Response Plan (IRP) for a common security incident: a malware infection. It is designed for small organizations or university IT teams and includes:

- A complete IR plan (`incident-response-plan.md`)
- A focused malware playbook (`playbook-malware.md`)
- Communication templates (`communication-templates.md`)
- Roles & responsibilities (`roles-and-responsibilities.md`)
- Evidence collection checklist and commands (`evidence-checklist.md`)
- A tabletop exercise script to validate the plan (`tabletop-exercise.md`)
- Slide bullets for quick presentation (`slides.md`)

## How to use
1. Review the IR plan and adapt contact names, phone numbers, and tools to your environment.
2. Run a tabletop exercise (use `tabletop-exercise.md`).
3. Store the plan in a secure internal repository and ensure key staff know where it is.
4. Keep the plan updated after incidents or quarterly.
